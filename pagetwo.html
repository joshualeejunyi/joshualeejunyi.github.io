            And while Joseph and Mary were at Bethlehem, the time came for baby Jesus to be born. But there was no room for them anywhere! The only place that they could find was with the animals. Mary gave birth to Jesus (this was sometimes called 'The Virgin Birth'), wrapped him in a blanket and laid him in a manger where animals ate their hay from.

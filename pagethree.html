            That night, some shepherds were in the fields. Suddenly, an angel appeared among them and said to them, "Don't be afraid! I bring joyful news: the Saviour has been born tonight in Bethlehem! How will you recognize him? You will find a baby wrapped in a blanket, lying in a manger!"

            <br><br>
            
            The shepherds ran to the village and found their way to Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger. The shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child. All who heard the shepherd's story expressed astonishment. Then they returned to their sheep, praising God for sending his Son to be their Saviour.

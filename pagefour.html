            At about that time, the Wise Men from the faraway lands arrived in Jerusalem, asking, "Where is the new-born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in far-off eastern lands and have come to worship him" There was a prophecy which sai the Saviour would be born in Bethlemen, so the Wise Men went there.
            <br><br>
            Look! The star appeared to them again, standing over Bethlehem. They were so joyful! Entering the house where Jesus was, they threw themselves down to worship him. Then they opened their presents and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
